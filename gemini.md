# Gemini Website Creator

## Overview

The Gemini Website Creator is a powerful tool that allows you to create websites using AI chat functionality. You can describe the website you want to create in plain English, and the AI will generate the HTML code for you. You can then preview the website in real-time and make changes as needed.

## How it works

The Gemini Website Creator uses a large language model to understand your requests and generate the HTML code for your website. The model has been trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which allows it to generate high-quality code that is both accurate and efficient.

When you enter a request in the chat, the model will first try to understand your intent. It will then generate the HTML code for your website and display it in the web preview panel. You can then make changes to the code as needed and see the results in real-time.
